# Syncronize changes from $1 to $2 where $1 is a local directory and $2 is local

# The script will start with full rsync without `--delete` flag. After that
# all changes, including removals of files will be synchronized.
#
# Note that this may not syncronize all files, just the changes detected by
# inotifywait. With high enough kernel limits, this should include all changes.
#
# To fix kernel limits, run following as root:
#
# # increase inotify limits
# echo 1000000 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events
# echo 1000000 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances
# echo 1000000 > /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches
#
# Max RAM usage for the kernel is 1 KB x max_user_watches
